# Breakout
This was my second computer science project with Jed Rembold in CS151. It is a recreation of the famous Atari game, Breakout.
<h2>Instructions</h2>
You have three lives in the game. To start, click the left mouse button. The ball will begin moving towards the bottom of the screen at a random angle. Use your mouse to move the paddle left and right in order to block the ball from hitting the bottom of the screen. If the ball hits the bottom of the screen you will lose a life and the ball will recenter itself, awaiting input of the left mouse again. Your goal is to break each of the colored boxes to win.
